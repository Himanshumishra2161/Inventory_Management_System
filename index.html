					<h3>Treadmill</h3>		
					<p>A treadmill is a device generally used for walking, running, or climbing while staying in the same place. Treadmills were introduced before the development of powered machines to harness the power of animals or humans to do work, often a type of mill operated by a person or animal treading the steps of a treadwheel to grind grain. In later times, treadmills were used as punishment devices for people sentenced to hard labor in prisons. The terms treadmill and treadwheel were used interchangeably for the power and punishment mechanisms.</p>

					<h3>Yoga</h3>		
					<p>Itâ€™s hard to find a wellness trend that has enjoyed more sustained buzz than yoga.

					The number of people practicing yoga in the United States grew more than 50 percent from 2012 to 2016, according to data. The survey found that people who practice yoga are more likely to be active in other forms of exercise like running or cycling, too, and that one in every three Americans said they were somewhat or very likely to practice yoga in the next 12 months.right up arrow
					No single reason is driving people to the millennia-old practice. Experts suspect it has something to do with yoga's combination of physical and mental health benefits.</p>
